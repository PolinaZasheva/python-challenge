The goal is to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.  
To accomplish this, reference the financial data stored in the file budget_data.csv.  
The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit and Losses

Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
   1. The total number of months included in the dataset.  
   2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.  
   3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.  
   4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.  
   5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.  

*In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results*
